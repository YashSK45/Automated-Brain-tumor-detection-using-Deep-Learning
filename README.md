# ðŸ§  Brain Tumor Detection using Deep Learning

A **deep learning-based web application** for detecting brain tumors from MRI images using **transfer learning** with **ResNet18**, built with **PyTorch** and deployed via **Streamlit**. This project aims to assist medical professionals and patients by providing a quick, interpretable, and reliable tool for identifying brain tumors from medical scans.

## ðŸ“– Project Overview

Brain tumors are a critical medical condition requiring early diagnosis for better treatment outcomes. Manual diagnosis from MRI images can be time-consuming and prone to human error. This project leverages deep learning techniques to automate tumor detection, providing an efficient and accurate solution.

The model is trained on labeled MRI images to classify whether a scan shows the presence of a brain tumor or not. It also incorporates **Grad-CAM** visualizations to explain the modelâ€™s predictions, making it more transparent and interpretable.
